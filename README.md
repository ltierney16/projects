Financial Planner

The financial planner allows you to make an account, log in, see how much money is in your account, 
make money transfers between your bank account and investing account, see current stocks by different
periods and measured with candlesticks of different time durations, add income streams and expenses
to your account, and view projected account balances bases on income/expenses.

I started this project because I have and interest in both coding and stocks so I though this would be
a project that would not only provide me valuable experience but also be enjoyable to work on.

For this project I used Flask, Python, HTML(CSS and Bulma for styling), and SQLite for databases.
