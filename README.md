# Financial Planner

The financial planner allows you to make an account, log in, see how much money is in your account, 
make money transfers between your bank account and investing account, see current stocks by different
periods and measured with candlesticks of different time durations, add income streams and expenses
to your account, and view projected account balances bases on income/expenses.

I started this project because I have and interest in both coding and stocks so I though this would be
a project that would not only provide me valuable experience but also be enjoyable to work on.

For this project I used Flask, Python, HTML(CSS and Bulma for styling), and SQLite for databases.

# TLS Proxy

The TLS Proxy allows a user to connect securely to any IP address of their choosing. The connection is encrypted using a TLS socket so that data cannot be intercepted along its route to the destination address.

The proxy is installed on a CloudLab node that the client script targets. The proxy script takes incoming packets and forwards them to the web server. The web server’s IP address must also be provided in the client script.

I started this project in my networking class and was able to take a deep dive into how to manipulate transport layer packets.

For this project, I used the Python modules socket and ssl, Flask, HTML (CSS and Bulma for styling), Wireshark for testing, CloudLab for server hosting, SSH for logging into sessions, and the command prompt for running commands.
